DESCRIPTION
The Raw Code plugin allows complete code (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) to be placed directly into Wordpress posts, pages, and widget content. 

By default Wordpress parses content entered into posts and pages and automatically inserts  '<p>' and '</p>'  paragraph tags around what it deems to be paragraph content. This breaks HTML, CSS,  javascript, and other code, preventing it from functioning. 

Follow these simple instructions to setup and use the Raw Code plugin.
